Readme file

Following this tutorial - https://blog.patricktriest.com/text-search-docker-elasticsearch/

To setup this search I had to do the following;

install docker
  https://docs.docker.com/install/
install docker compose
  https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-composehttps://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

  The setup in docker-compose.yml is pointing all ports to localhost.  Update ports here.
 - this file is also tying in the API, frontend and search containers.
